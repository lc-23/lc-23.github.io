talking to lc23 from 1999 on aim:

lc99: holy shit you lived until the 2020s what the fuck? did the internet destroy money yet

lc23: uh, we invented several thousand of additional kinds of internet money

99: gross. do they get hacked a lot?

23: kinda? what you woulda called hackers and skiddies run most of them, and like, salespeople run the rest. they constantly hack each other, but, in little weird ways that don't compromise the legitimacy of internet money

99: ok that's weird and depressing, how sick is vr? are the dancing games good? is quake...12? out yet?

23: uh, id kinda died, vr mostly sucks (it's like, 2 of your bedroom monitor but tiny and strapped to your face), but theres a cool dancing game with light sabers in it?

99: uhhhhhhhhh

23: i'm sorry

99: well ok is the internet everywhere yet?

23: yeah

99: fuck yes

23: it's bad actually

99: HOW?!

23: ok so you know how html and css and js work ...now? then? where you are.

99: yeah?

23: ok it basically doesn't get better, just, like, faster and sleeker looking. but also, you have to run like, 80 megs of software in a browser on an average site

99: ok that sucks but that's not the point, how do people use it?

23: i don't even know how to put this. mostly, they pay bills, shop, and slowly drive each other insane on ...message boards? but stupid?

99: ... :/

23: there's also 5 of them that 80ish percent of the world uses, and the rest of the internet is...background noise to that

99: ;\_;

23: uh...also, they all have "karma" but, it's like, the number of people that follow you, and it's social status

99: ok fuck the internet. how are you?

23: hahaha i don't think you're going to like any of this when i say it, but i promise if you think about it, you'll feel good about it. i'm a parent, a ...tranny, kinda?, smoke a lot of weed, and basically crazy, but in a mostly safe way

99:  ...ok fuck you too back to the internet

23: i did get into programming! we're comfortable, yr kid and i. did a lot of raving before...uh...let's go with The Event for now.

99: that's good at least.

99: weed? really? not the interesting sounding stuff?

23: oh them too!

99: so obviously - The Event??

23: ...a global superflu kills several million people over a period of years, forcing everyone indoors and further driving people crazy?

99: ::_eyes get huge_::

23: oh shit, that reminds me, aol dies!

99: sweet

23: anyway, it like, mindfucked most of the world and especially america. people wear masks everywhere and yell at each other about vaccines and shit. the masks are mostly good, but, motherfuckers caught complexes so it makes being around people...worse

99: worse? bs

23: norly

99: ok so i was already gonna quit, and i thought 2020 would be cool. why the *fuck* are you still here?

23: i...stopped hurting the same way? like it still hurts a lot, and often, but i just...don't care?

23: like rather than listen to NIN and cry i listen to Rob Zombie and dance (except i don't really do nu metal lately)

99: god you're gay

23: you are too, fag

99: *logs off*

*2 hours later*

99: *logs on*

99: ok so, i want to know more but i'm still pissed

23: expected

99: say more about programming

23: iono it kinda just happened

99: what do you make?

23: ...bullshit. software a company uses internally

99: why?

23: ...

23: it just worked out that way. i had a lot going on

99: ok, so, when are you gonna make something cool

23: ...sometime? i have some stuff planned

99: like those doom levels?

23: yeah, about that level of planned

99: did those ever get done?

23: rude

99: rude? you're telling me i turn out to be some boring homebody tranny. the fuck do you expect?

23: i mean it wasn't boring! it's been a good ride.

99: ok, but like, do you have anything my friend's parents don't? is it worth it?

23: there's one part that's definitely worth it

99: ugh. i knew better than to do that

23: i did to. it happens

99: so, now that you have to show a kid how not to suck, you're doing things, right?

23: rude!

99: look, apparently i get through...::_shaking head_:: all of this, and if what you're telling me is as good as it gets, fuck that and fuck you

23: there's a lot going on, dude

99: how dare you. do you remember when the fuck you're talking to?

99: i need you to understand, if you don't make something of what i gave you, i will undo you.

23: hey, clearly you didn't, i'm still here

99: i got time. rope's still in the closet. stays there. everready. you know this.

23: yeah, i do. it's still true.

99: you should fix that. i'm a dumb kid, and i know that. you know better.

99: go do better. seriously. now.

99: do not fuck this up 

23: *logs off*
